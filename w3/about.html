            <h2>Why I am taking CIT85: HTML & CSS</h2>
            <p>Ever since myspace, I've really enjoyed (amateurly) coding with HTML and CSS. Fast forward to college, I
                pursued (and earned) a degree in mathematics. My last semester at Fresno State, I took CSCI40: Intro to
                C++, and
                that's when I knew I wanted to be a software developer. I graduated in 2020,
                right after the COVID shutdown, so I took a bit of a hiatus from school and just focused on my career. I
                ended up landing an internship as a data analyst, where I had to adapt and learn very quickly. During my
                time as a data analyst, I've picked up all sorts of skills, including SQL and Python. When I started
                programming in Python, I knew I wanted to pivot into some sort of developer. I had really been
                interested in becoming a data engineer (I love creating pipelines and automating data processes). I
                really love watching my code run and work, there is something so satisfying about it that also gives me
                a sense of accomplishment. Now, I am working on getting my A.S. in Computer Information Technology: Web
                Development. I'm excited to finish this degree and pick up some cool skills along the way. I'm really
                interested in creating my own website, and also learning JavaScript next semester!</p>

            <h2>My thoughts on using ChatGPT for researching webpage content</h2>
            <p>My preference is Claude.ai, but I liked using ChatGPT as well. I think prompt engineering will definitely
                be a
                necessary skill going forward, so being able to practice that was useful and informative. It definitely
                made picking a
                topic way easier. Without it, creating content would have been the more difficult and time-consuming
                part of this project. For web development - I think I would rather work with a design team and execute
                their vision. ChatGPT will do for now! :-)</p>
